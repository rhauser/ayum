1. Get the software

   git clone /afs/cern.ch/work/r/rhauser/public/ayum

   Or just 

   cp -r /afs/cern.ch/work/r/rhauser/public/ayum .

2. Edit the ayum shell script

   You should adapt the four variables:

   AYUM_DBPATH
   AYUM_CACHE
   AYUM_INSTALL_AREA

   Optionally: AYUM_CONF or just use the yum.conf file
   in the package and modify it as you like.

3. Either put the package into your path:
 
   export PATH=/path/to/ayum:$PATH

   or use the full path name in the following where the 'ayum'
   command is used.

4. Enjoy

   ayum list
   ayum list available
   ayum shell (quit to exit)
   ayum install -y tdaq-04-00-01_DAQRelease_i686-slc5-gcc43-opt
   ayum update
   ayum list installed

   ...and so on, all yum commands

   ayum remove tdaq-04-00-01-*
